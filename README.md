# First Person Template
###### For UPBGE 0.2.3
This template was created to help Blender Game Engine (UPBGE) users to create games or any kind of interactive thing that request a First Person Controller. Easy to use, easy to attach to your project.

To use, just download the **.blend** file, open it on UPBGE (version 0.2.3 recommended) and you're done! If you want to use this template in your projects (and yes, you can, even for commercial projects. Just credit me for this.), you can simple select the Capsule Object + Camera, press Ctrl+C, open your  project and press Ctrl+V. It will work. :)
